# Automatic tests

After completing all the steps in the project, automatic tests will become available to you. Tests are run on each commit: once all tasks in the Hexlet interface are completed, make a commit and the tests will run automatically.

The Hexlet-hosted workflow is no longer part of this repository; use your preferred CI configuration to trigger project checks.
